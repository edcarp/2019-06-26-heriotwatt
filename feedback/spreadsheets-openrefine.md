# Feedback from Day 1 AM

## Green Post-Its (Positives)
### General
* The instructors are cool, the food is very okay, very interactive.
* Nice workshop with great helpers.
* The course content is very relevant for those doing research.
* Instructors and helpers are very helpful. They helped ASAP when I had a problem.
* It was a helpful class for me. I had some questions which were solved as soon as possible by you. Cheers.
* Liked how it covered 'simple' things that perhaps a lot of people (like me!) aren't aware of!
* Very informative and useful for day to day.
* Thank you for this workshop. It was useful tools that I will use.
* Good practice.

### Spreadsheets
* There were datasets ready for the course, this sped things up.

### Open Refine
* Open Refine is a good tool and tutorial was helpful.
* Open Refine was amazing! Session was well delivered!
* Open Refine would be handy to use. Could have been expanded on more.
* Enjoyed the intro to Open Refine. Interesting and realistic sets of 'bad' data.
* Guide/demo of Open Refine very useful (not used this before).

## Orange Post-Its (Improvements)
### General
* Pictures in the course notes help (this does not replace a good set of slides!)
* It would be helpful if the exercise table had the file to download to work with.
* I had an issue hearing the instructor, the volume could be up.
* The microphone could be used more. Sometimes I got lost on where we are. More detail could be given. Some examples can be given to be solved and brought the next day by students.
* R should run in the morning.

### Spreadsheets
* I didn't need any of the Excel content as this covered things I already knew.
* Have slides rather than reading a lot of text to the audience. This made it impossible to follow.
* The first part of the workshop only focuses on social sciences.

### Pace
* Pace was too fast. Ensure that everyone is one the same page with the instructor otherwise catching up would be a challenge.
* Probably didn't need as much time between exercises.
* Bit slower with Open Refine, but it was very cool to learn about.
* Teachings are too fast, instruction time should be more.
* Session on Open Refine was too fast, it would have been much better if the exercises were elaborated further.
* Pace was a little too fast.
* Pace could have been faster, or less content so it doesn't feel like we're skipping a lot.
